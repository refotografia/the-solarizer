<h5>This is one of 3 apps that I have created recently. I have been investigating in<br>
programming for so long, but never really got into doing it. Life took its turns, <br>
and I was presented with a chance to explore deeper into it and refresh some couple<br>
decades old knowlodge on image processing.</h5>

<h5>I have had a lot of fun creating solarized prints in the darkroom for ages.<br>
Now I believe is time to explore what can be done this way.</h5>
<h5>So this a simple app in Python, PyQT, PIL and Numpy to take advantage of how easy <br>
  it is to manipulate each pixel value.</h5>
<h5>You need choose 1 image to start with - has to be 8-bit. Can be colour image or <br>
  monochromatic, the app will create extra channels if needed.</h5>
